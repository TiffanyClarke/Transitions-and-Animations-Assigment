				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>In this assignment, you are to use transitions and/or animations to complete a given task <em>or series of tasks</em> for each activity.</p>
				<h2>Guidelines</h2>
				<p>The guidelines are simple:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't edit the HTML. You only need to open styles.css (not default.css) and start creating the CSS.</li>
					<li>Read each activity task(s) <em>extremely</em> carefully to be sure you are doing exactly what is asked.</li>
					<li>Read the intro comments at the top of the style.css - there is important information there!</li>
					<li>When I say "the element", I am refering to the red box in each activity.</li>
					<li>Unless otherwise specified, each transition should complete and then transition itself back to the default setting (no smooth sliding one direction, and jerking back to the original place!)</li>
					<li>Please keep durations and delays short (nothing more than 5s) so I don't have to sit here for an hour waiting for something to move. Laammmeee!</li>
					<li>You may (probably will) have to visit <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_new">W3Schools</a> to do some research!</li>
					<li>Remember the property values for the original box (see them in the comments at the top of style.css). There is no need to re-declare those same values in your CSS and in fact, marks will be deducted for repeated values!</li>
					<li>Hint: animation names don't take integers well (ie, "seven" works where "7" does not)</li>
					<li><strong>Double check each activity before submission to ensure it works! If it doesn't work when I grade it, it gets a zero.</strong></li>
				</ul>

					<h2>Activity 1</h2>
					<p><strong>Task:</strong> Make the element slide 100px to the right when hovered over.</p>
					<div class="activity1"></div>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Activity 2</h2>
					<p><strong>Task:</strong> Make the element grow to twice it's original size when hovered over.</p>
					<div class="activity2"></div>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Activity 3</h2>
					<p><strong>Task:</strong> Make the element shrink to half it's original size when hovered over.</p>
					<div class="activity3"></div>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Activity 4</h2>
					<p><strong>Task:</strong> Over a two second period, make the element grow to 300px wide AND change colour to blue when hovered over. Give the change an easing value of <em>ease-in-out</em>.</p>
					<div class="activity4"></div>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Activity 5</h2>
					<p><strong>Task:</strong> Using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_2dtransforms.asp" target="new">transforms</a>, rotate the element a total of two full rotations over a three second period when hovered over. <em>Hint: How many degrees is one full rotation?</em></p>
					<div class="activity5"></div>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Activity 6</h2>
					<p><strong>Task:</strong> Using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_2dtransforms.asp" target="new">transforms</a>, rotate the element counter-clockwise by one full rotation over a two second period using an easing value of <em>linear</em>. Also, make the effect happen one full second after the element is hovered over.</p>
					<div class="activity6"></div>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Activity 7</h2>
					<p><strong>Task:</strong> Make the element hover like a cloud, 1em up then 1em back down to it's original position. Each iteration should take three seconds to complete and the effect should continue infinitely.</p>
					<div class="activity7"></div>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Activity 8</h2>
					<p><strong>Task:</strong> Make the element become completely transparent over a three second period of time. The element should remain transparent when the effect is complete.</p>
					<div class="activity8"></div>
